# Full Stack Open 2022

All the projects I have done from the Full Stack Open course from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki.

### Quick Overview:
The course is designed for students to learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! 
This course will introduce students to modern JavaScript-based web development. 
The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.
